Easily create posts and pages visible only for selected users of your blog

== Description ==

This plugin will enable you to

* Create Reading Groups and associate them with users and private posts and private pages

* Once these users logged in they will see those private posts and private pages which you granted access to

* Publish your posts and pages to general public as usual

Your users will not be aware (unless you tell them) of what Reading Groups they are part of (if any).

== Installation ==

2. Extract to `/wp-content/plugins/wp-jv-post-reading-groups` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to create Reading Groups? =

Go to Settings -> Reading to create your Reading Groups.

= How to assign Reading Groups to Users? =

Go to Users -> All Users and select a non-admin user (admins have access to all RGs anyway) and grant permissions to Reading Groups of your choice.

When you add a New User you will be able to select Reading Groups as well.

= How to assign Reading Groups to Posts? =

Go to Posts -> Edit Post and select who will be able to read that post. **Don't forget to publish that post privately.**

= I added a page/post to the menu as custom link. Why is it visible for everyone? =

The plugin does not remove any links added to the menu this way as it is unable to distinguish between URLs pointing to the site or elsewhere.

The plugin is able to dynamically remove the ones a user has no permission, but to do that
1. add then create a page/post and publish it with visibility=public,
2. add it to the menu,
3. then set the page/post visibility=private (if you first set the post/page to private you won't find it in the list of pages/posts when trying to add it to the menu).
